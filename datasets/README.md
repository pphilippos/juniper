## Example datasets for Juniper

This directory includes example multi-dimensional datasets for testing Juniper. ``TOP500_202406.csv`` is the June 2024 list by Top500.org (converted from the official ``.xml`` file). ``TOP500_202406_co.csv`` is a small variation of the latter on the "Accelerator/Co-Processor" field to only differentiate between supercomputers with accelerators and those without.

Note that the author is not affiliated with Top500, and they are provided for indicative purposes. If needed, they easily be excluded, as Juniper does not depend on these files for its operation.
